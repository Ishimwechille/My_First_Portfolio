    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>This is my very first HTML project where I am learning to create clean and valid HTML pages. I am excited to share my progress and growth as a developer.</p>

    <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>My main goal is to become a skilled software developer with strong knowledge of web development and networking. I am currently practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build beautiful and functional web applications.</p>

    <p>Through this portfolio, I will showcase projects, highlight my skills, and document my learning journey in programming and technology.</p>

    <p>I also plan to share my interests in cybersecurity, network engineering, and backend development. This project represents the first step toward achieving my career goals.</p>
